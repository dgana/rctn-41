                <p>On June 2020, I finished my bachelor program on software engineering from Wuhan University. Throughout my 4 years of bachelor degree, I’ve learned many programming & IT related knowledge. Most of the courses have taught me a lot of theory knowledge that are important for software developer such as software testing, memory management, data structure, etc. Also, I’ve been involved with some projects on some of the courses. One of project that I think is quite beneficial was when I tried to implement a supervised and unsupervised learning of machine learning with Python. I’ve also attended internship to give me working experience and also gave me an insight on how programming is used in real life situation. Lastly, I’ve joined some organizations to gave me an experience on how to work well with other people. I’m looking forward for new experiences and also my first job after graduated from university. </p>
